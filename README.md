# UAV Network Traffic Identification Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to identify network traffic patterns of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for enhanced privacy and security monitoring.

### Overview
The project classifies network traffic as either drone or non-drone, utilizing features like packet inter-arrival times and IP addresses to differentiate encrypted traffic. It compares multiple models, including logistic regression, SVM, and MLP neural networks.
